🌟 Web Application Full Feature Specification (Netlify Deployment)
1️⃣ Landing Page — Keyword Generator
✅ Word/Category Input:

A text box where the user can enter any word or category they want to generate related keywords for.

Example: nature, technology, abstract.

✅ Keyword Count Input:

A numeric input box where users can specify how many keywords to generate.

Default value = 50.

User can adjust the number (e.g. 10, 25, 100), but must be a valid positive integer.

✅ API Buttons:

"Generate with Gemini" button → Calls Gemini API to generate the requested number of unique, category-related keywords.

"Generate with OpenRouter" button → Calls OpenRouter API using the selected model to generate the requested number of unique keywords.

✅ Keyword Rules:

The system ensures all generated keywords are:

Unique — no repeats or overly similar keywords.

Related to the entered word/category.

✅ Keyword Progress Display:

Shows a live counter:

Example: Keywords generated: 0 / 50 → Updates as keywords are generated.

2️⃣ API Settings — OpenRouter Configuration
✅ Settings Button:

Opens a settings panel where users can:

Enter and save their OpenRouter API key.

Click "Fetch Models" to pull the latest available models from OpenRouter (live).

View list of models and select the preferred model.

Click "Confirm Model" to set their chosen model for future OpenRouter calls.

3️⃣ Copy & Step Transition — From Keywords to Prompts
✅ Copy Keywords Button:

Copies all generated keywords to clipboard.

Automatically transitions the user to the Prompt Generator (Step 2) page.

Pre-fills the prompt input box with copied keywords (1 keyword per line).

✅ Manual Input Fallback:

If no keywords copied, users can manually paste or enter their own list of keywords.

4️⃣ Prompt Generator — Type & Count
✅ Prompt Type Selection:

Two buttons:

Photography → Prompts will be structured for photo generation.

Vector → Prompts will be structured for vector art generation.

✅ Prompt Count Input:

A numeric input box for how many prompts to generate.

Default value = 50.

Users can set this to match their keyword count or any positive integer.

✅ Prompt Input Box:

Pre-filled with copied keywords after Copy Keywords button.

Allows manual typing or pasting of keywords if no copy was made.

✅ Prompt Rules:

Each keyword generates exactly one unique prompt.

No similar or duplicate prompts — each is distinct.

Each prompt ends with a period.

Each prompt starts on a new line — no extra spaces, symbols, or headings.

Output looks like:

Copy
Edit

✅ Prompt Progress Display:

Shows live counter:

Example: Prompts generated: 0 / 50 → Updates as prompts are created.
